# Double Parking Notification App
Greetings! We are Daniel, Wen Yuan, Sabrina and Jia Sheng and welcome to our Double Parking Notification System! This prototype solution stems from an ongoing issue of double parking incidents in busy areas in Malaysia. Feel free to check our our web application here [Double Parking Notification App](https://wychin229.github.io/double_park_sys/) (usage of the web app will be explain in section below "How To Use")

We highly encourage you to view our submission videos for this Hackathon!

## About the web application
This web application is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and several other JavaScript and CSS libraries. We have also implemented Firebase as a backend into our system. 

Compared to the prototype in Round 2, this web application is our final complete product that we are proud to present!

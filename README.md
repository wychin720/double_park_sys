# Double Parking Notification App
Greetings! We are Daniel, Wen Yuan, Sabrina and Jia Sheng and welcome to our Double Parking Notification System! This final web application solution stems from an ongoing issue of double parking incidents in busy areas in Malaysia. Feel free to check our our web application here [Double Parking Notification App](https://wychin229.github.io/double_park_sys/) (usage of the web app will be explain in section below "How To Use")

We highly encourage you to view our submission videos for this Hackathon!

## About the web application
This web application is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and several other JavaScript and CSS libraries. We have also implemented Firebase as a backend into our system. 

Compared to the prototype in Round 2, this web application is our final complete product that we are proud to present!

## How To Use
The following will be a quick summary of key pages that we would like to highlight. First click this [Double Parking Notification App](https://wychin229.github.io/double_park_sys/) link. If you are on browser, please **open Developer Tools/Inspect and view on Mobile mode**. Alternatively, you may **view this link on your mobile phone**. You will first be greeted with the following page:

To try out "Searching a Vehicle", you will see the following to enter a vehicle plate. We have some pre-set number plates that you may try; DEF1234. Additionally, you may go to the "Sign Up" page and key in your own details and number plate, and try searching your details after "Signing in" and "Checking in" your vehicle.

"Signing In" simply asks you to enter your email and password, to which you will then be brought to this page:

You may enter some text in the location(s) to signify the locations you are headed to when you block someone's vehicle. The "estimated time taken" is the rough time you'll be away from your vehicle.

If you would like to "Sign Up":

Lastly, each user that signs up will have a profile as follows:

That concludes the quick summary, do refer to the Round 2 video [here](https://youtu.be/7qYWFXDlBHQ) where we demo further the flow between each page! (This was the previous prototype but the essential flow is there. This sentence will be removed if we produce a separate demo video)
